# Custom Emacs configuration

This repository contains my configuration for Emacs.
It is using extensively the elpa packages, have a custom binding for the packages, ...

Many (many?) improvements have still to be done.

Clone this repository in your ~/.emacs.d, and add
`(when (file-exists-p "~/.emacs.d/init.el") (load "~/.emacs.d/init.el"))`
to your `~/.emacs`.
